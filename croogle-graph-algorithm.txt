*   Need a ruby file called sort-by-character.rb that takes stdin and
    outputs lines sorted by the number of instances of the specified
    character contained in each line.

    Can I put this logic into php?
    How much of the logic can I put into php? The entire graphviz
    filegen?

    *   From sphinx search results, I have a list of file paths.
        Sort alphanumerically.
        Then sort by the number of '/' characters.
        Generate the graphviz file entirely in php.

        # This is what I want.

        # How did I find? Google 'php sort callback'.
